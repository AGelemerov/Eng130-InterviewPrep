# Questions and answers for interview

## Technical questions

### What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices which use tools to help the organisation deliver services at high speed.
This helps the organisation to develop software quicker than traditional software development.
Embraces team collaboration and communication in the workplace to aid productivity and innovation.

### Benefits of DevOps
Faster delivery of software via Continuous delivery and Continuous integration. 
Fast adaptation to changes in user needs, providing a more positive experience more frequently to end users.
As automation is a key practice in DevOps, management and operations are easier to control and used to solve problems 
quicker if needed
As DevOps uses the Agile methodology, constant communication between client and developers is present,
improving quality of product to high standards.
This teamwork gets teams to share responsibility and collaborate closely, reducing inneficiencies and saving
time.
### What is a VPC?
VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud, it closely resembles the traditional networks that operated in data centres. It is the main building block for a network as it provides network level security for your application. It acts as a firewall to let traffic in and out of the system. There are many components which relate to it such as an Internet Gateway, Routing table, NACLs, Subnets, Security groups and instances/servers. Would you like me to elaborate on all of the components and what they do and are used for?

### Describe CI/CD process, from making changes to code and integrating into the pipeline?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. It used to manage the development pipeline and automate it to different degrees. The pipeline itself consists of 4 stages: Build, Test, Release to development, Deploy to production. The CI part automates the Build and Test part of the pipeline, CD involves CI and the Release process but the deployment is manual. There is another thing you can do to automate further and that is Continuous Deployment, with a push from the development side, the code gets built, tested, released and deployed to the public. Every stage is dependent on the previous, such that for example stage 3 does not run of stage 2 has an error.

### What is PR (Pull Request) ?
A PR is a request to a version control system such as Git. It involves the "pulling"/downloading of code from online to your local machine. There can be synchonisation problems with this, such as This happens when other members of the teams have uploaded or pushed changes to the system and we want to see those changes or just be updated on what is happening with the project or a certain feature.

### What is docker and docker compose file ?
Docker is a containerisation service which provides us with a platform which we can use to integrate and manage our own infrastructure. It is open source and free so a lot of companies use it. It utilises the container approach to developing services, also known as microservices. A docker compose file is a file which uses a scripting language called YAML. It is used to define the microservices you would like to launch on a specific host. Each service is defined simply and is given instruction on how you would like it to be configured.
### What is the difference between a monolith and a 2-tier architecture?
To understand the difference we must know what each of those two mean. Monolithic style architecture is one where all functionality and data is stored in one server. 2-tier architecture divides the core elements of the monolith architecture in two: the main functionality (app server) and the data storage (database server). As you can imagine the Monolith architecture is used in small limited applications that do not require expansion. 2-tier architecture on the other hand, provides greater scalability/greater expansion opportunities as the two main services are seperate.
## Soft skills questions

### How do you handle stress?
University and the academy taught me how to be organised and manage my time a lot better. Throughout the academy I applied this skill and now I organise my day much like a scrum board and prioratise different tasks differently. All in all I would say I am pretty good with handling stress, it helps me really focus on what I need to do and I find myself being more productive and focused while under heavier load.

### Why DevOps?
I have always had a passion for computer science in general. In university we had a module which explored Software Development and DevOps and their differences and I was really interested. I am a team player and a leader if needed so the collaboration and communication is very suitable for my style of interaction. Automation also was a factor that drove me to applying for such a role as I find it fascinating and satisfying to produce something that does everything you want and more.
### Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years?
I have a few goals that I have set myself, for now I would like to pass the academy. After which I would like to upskill myself whether that is while I am on site or on the bench waiting for a placement. In the further future, I would love to guide others and help them develop themselves while also focusing on improving myself by upskilling or helping team members.
### What can you bring to our team?
I can provide commucation, teamwork, time mamagement skills to any team. I handle stress and deadlines well. I focus on details a lot to make sure the client or leader is happy with what I produce. I am a realistic but positive person in general and this helps others have more confidence while I know exactly what I am capable of. My coding experience due to university and my general interest in computer science has helped me through the academy a lot and I believe it will in the workplace.
